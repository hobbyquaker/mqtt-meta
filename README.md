It's intended to be used as a database for storing metadata in systems that use MQTT as message bus, I'm using it in 
conjunction with [mqtt-smarthome](https://github.com/mqtt-smarthome/mqtt-smarthome), but I think it could be useful in
other MQTT based environments also.

You can create and modify documents by publishing JSON payloads to MQTT and receive document changes by simply 
subscribing to certain topics. You can create views by defining map and reduce functions and filter document ids with 
MQTT style wildcards.
