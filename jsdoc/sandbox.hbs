**Documentation of the sandbox in which the _map_ and _reduce_ scripts are executed.**

Keep in mind that you don't have access to Node.js globals like e.g. `require`, `process` or `console` and that the
documents in the sandbox are frozen, so no change on the database contents is possible by the _map_ and _reduce_
scripts.
